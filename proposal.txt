MVP

1. Graphical representation of a grid
    - Grid buttons are clickable and interactive

2. Evaluation of game state upon clicking on a grid button
    - Upon click, if grid has not been revealed yet, grid should evaluate to the following states:
        a. does not contain a mine, and there are no mines in all adjacent squares (incl. diagonal)
        b. does not contain a mine, and if there are adjacent mines, the grid square shows the # of adjacent mines (incl. diagonal)
        c. contains a mine, and game is over

3. Reset / new game function
